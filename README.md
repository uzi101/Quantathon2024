# OSU Quantathon 2024 Challenge: Commodity Trading Analysis 📈

## Project Overview 🌍
This project is part of the 2024 OSU Quantathon, where I took on the role of a commodities analyst at Buckeye Capital, a leading investment firm. My task was to analyze the markets, specifically focusing on crude oil (WTI Crude) and Delta Airlines (DAL) stock prices, to devise lucrative trading strategies. With an initial capital of $10,000, the challenge was to maximize returns through strategic investments in these assets.

## Data and Resources 📊
The analysis is based on historical price data for crude oil and Delta Airlines from March 24, 2014, to March 24, 2024. This includes open, high, low, close, adjusted close prices, and trading volumes. The data provided a comprehensive view to model and forecast future price movements and investment strategies.

## Investment Options 💸
- **Crude Oil (WTI Crude)**: A vital resource powering various modes of transport and industries.
- **Delta Airlines (DAL)**: A major airline with extensive global flight services.
- **Money Market**: An alternative to hold capital, earning an interest of 5.27%.

## Strategy and Analysis 📝
### Model Development
The core of this project was to develop a model that could identify the best trading strategy based on historical price movements and market trends.

### Strategy Evaluation
A crucial part of the analysis was defining what constitutes the 'best' trading strategy. This involved comparing various strategies to determine which yielded the highest returns with acceptable risk levels.

### Investment Timeframe
Selecting an optimal timeframe for investment and rebalancing was essential for maximizing returns and adapting to market changes.

## Techniques and Tools 🛠
- **Rolling Window Strategy**: To capture trends and adjust positions over time.
- **Buy-and-Hold Strategy**: Assessing the value of a long-term investment approach.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining the relationship between crude oil prices and Delta Airlines stock prices.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Predicting market movements by analyzing sentiments around crude oil.

## How to Run the Project 🚀
Detailed instructions on how to set up the environment, run the analysis, and interpret the results are provided in the repository's documentation.

## Contribution and Collaboration 👥
I encourage collaboration and contributions to enhance the model's accuracy and performance. Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues for discussions and suggestions.

## Future Steps 🔮
Going forward, I aim to refine the trading model by incorporating more dynamic data sources, applying advanced machine learning techniques, and exploring more sophisticated risk management strategies.

## Submission and Contact 📝
A detailed video presentation and the GitHub repository link will be submitted as per the Quantathon's guidelines. For further inquiries or collaboration, feel free to contact me through GitHub or the provided communication channels on the Discord server.
